    bio: "I bridge the gap between strategic Product Management and technical Engineering. Currently an MBA candidate at Golden Gate University, I specialize in the '0-to-1' lifecycle—identifying raw user pain points and architecting scalable AI solutions. My superpower is Resilience: I view failures as data points for iteration.",
    philosophy: "AI is not a replacement; it is the ultimate Assistant. It equips us to make better decisions, simplifies complex processes, and helps us understand concepts without sifting through hundreds of research papers.",
